# NBA data analytics project 

## This is a small EDA (exploratory data analysis) project consisting of 2 parts :

### 1. Scrapping nba.com using the python nba_api and collecting simple data from the endpoint 'commonplayerinfo' (players info like height, weight, team, experience, draft year, basic stats like pts/ast/reb). The goal was to collect the data for all NBA players (from beginning 1946 until the moment of the project,ie, 2025). This has been done using the notebook 'scrapping-nba-data-with-the-nba-api'.

### 2. Then, I made basic EDA (notebook 'eda-of-nba-players-height-weight-and-basic-stats') using the collected data (2 csv files). I mainly focused on height-weight analysis of NBA players as well as basic stats evolution segmented by position of the player (guard, center).
